I like to treat this page as a bit of a personal garden. I've got a few links below, mostly related to things I'm currently interested in or have been interested in. I don't really do social media anymore, and much prefer the unwalled garden of a website that is entirely mine to do with whatever I feel like.

Feel free to take a look around!

ps - this page has an RSS feed, which I use to post blogs. Keep in touch!

# About me

I enjoy learning new things. This includes technology, physical skills and learning new sports. A few of the activities I are referenced here.

I love reading and try to read a few books every month, usually a mix of fiction and non-fiction.

# My personal pages:

* [Writing](/writing/writing/) - I'm working on my ability to communicate through writing. This is the workshop. 
* [Sailing](/about/sailing/) - Some sailing pics and a logbook
* [Surfing](/about/surfing/) - Every surfboard I've ever owned
* [Media](/about/media/) - Videos of me doing things
* [Photography](https://film.rdrn.dev/film) - Dragging around a film camera for fun and personal development...
* [Recipe Book](https://food.rdrn.dev/) - Some great stuff in there, ask me about my bread!

1. [CommitLearn](https://mattarderne.github.io/CommitLearn/) - This was an experimental audio learning experience using podcasts. Podcasts are just RSS feeds, so why not hack together your own playlist? Still think this is a good idea.

1. [kaya.chat](https://mattarderne.github.io/kaya.chat/) - A hackathon entry. A mentorship & student support service, facilitating & automating mentorship, guidance networks and informed support.
