This page is about me broadly, while work related can be found in [engineering](/engineering).

I like to treat this page as a bit of a personal garden. I've got a few links below, mostly related to things I'm currently interested in or have been interested in. 

<- Highlights are linked on the left. Feel free to take a look around.

ps - this page has an [RSS feed](/feed.xml), I recommend [feedly](https://feedly.com/)
