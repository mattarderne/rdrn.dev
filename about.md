This page is about me. Work can be found in [engineering](/engineering).

I like to treat this page as a garden. I've got a few links below, mostly related to things current and past interests. 

# About me

1. Currently based in {{site.location}}
1. From South Africa (Cape Town & St Francis)
1. Industrial Engineer before moving into data (all about making decisions)
1. I like being outdoors. I'm competitive, enjoy adrenaline, and like pushing myself
1. I enjoy learning new things. This includes technology, skills and new sports
1. I try to read a few books every month, usually a mix of fiction and non-fiction
