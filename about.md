This page is about me broadly, while work related [advisory](/advisory) and [engineering](/engineering) are in those links. I like to treat this page as a bit of a personal garden. I've got a few links below, mostly related to things I'm currently interested in or have been interested in. I don't really do social media anymore [1], and much prefer the unwalled garden of a website that is entirely mine to do with whatever I feel like.

<- Highlights are linked on the left. Feel free to take a look around!

ps - this page has an RSS feed, which I use to post blogs. Keep in touch!

# About me

I enjoy learning new things. This includes technology, physical skills and learning new sports. A few of the activities I are referenced here.

I love reading and try to read a few books every month, usually a mix of fiction and non-fiction.

# My personal pages:

* [Writing](/writing/overview/) - I'm working on my ability to communicate through writing. This is the workshop. 
* [Sailing](/about/sailing/) - Some sailing pics and a logbook
* [Surfing](/about/surfing/) - Every surfboard I've ever owned
* [Media](/about/media/) - Videos of me doing things
* [Photography](https://film.rdrn.dev/film) - Dragging around a film camera for fun and personal development...
* [Recipe Book](https://food.rdrn.dev/) - Some great stuff in there, ask me about my bread!

# Projects

Project(s) that I am working on and developing. In order of interest:
1. [focal.page](https://focal.page) - Consulting and product development in the space of SME Fintech.
1. [reinform.io](http://reinform.io) - Research into misinformation.

# Old projects

Roughly in order of interest:
1. [waves](http://rdrn.com/waves) - Involving waves and neural nets Wrapped this up. If you are interested in contributing to an open-data surf map, lmk.
1. [CommitLearn](https://mattarderne.github.io/CommitLearn/) - This was an experimental audio learning experience using podcasts. Podcasts are just RSS feeds, so why not hack together your own playlist? Still think this is a good idea.
1. [concentrait](https://mattarderne.github.io/concentrait/) - The learning optimization API. Edtech has a long way to go.
1. [kaya.chat](https://mattarderne.github.io/kaya.chat/) - A hackathon entry. A mentorship & student support service, facilitating & automating mentorship, guidance networks and informed support. 

# My talented brothers

If you are in the market for someone smart but I don't quite match up, please take a look at my exceptionally talented brothers:

* [Chris](https://rdrn.me/) - intersection of data science and energy access
* [Andrew](https://github.com/zoomie) - Python, go, algorithms, concurrency
