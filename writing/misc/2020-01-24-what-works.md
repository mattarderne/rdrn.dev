### **Existential**

The dual threat this week of [climate-change](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/01/grim-new-definition-generation-x) and a [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_outbreak_of_novel_coronavirus_(2019-nCoV)) sharpens the mind, especially with attention snatchers like the following, which I suppose may be true of any time in history.

> People born in the 1960s may be the last human beings who will get to live out their full actuarial life expectancies

### **Work**

Two ways to make sure you get the most out of your career.

1.  How to be [effective](http://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJwlUEGOgzAMfE1zWxQbsoFDDqhqv4FC4m2jhQQlZit-v6GVLI81tmY0dpbpkfJhtlRY7IXyFLxBrZXWKLyRGp2eRSjTTyZabViM2PZ5Cc5ySPE8Bo1dK55m8B0Ovu-dU3oeekCrFTmlQLfWDroXp8Vkdx8oOjL0R_lIkcRinsxbubTjBe-1OK0uB3bPJb0al9ZKoYShAsDZ-toOKl82-jqJYFCilAAIqlNSNtCMo4KrlFe4fsP9dm8vnVwf0JR9Lmzd7ykqslkbmz3lSHX9OJO9-RpuqrjuMfAxUbTzQt5w3knw50nvGHxsZCK9ykLMlD_k-TnEFqWoVj5VzWiyz_Ef1Y10wA) in the theatre of work:

    > _The office is a theatre, and work is an unfolding narrative on the stage._
    > 
    > _Many people aspire to “silent success” at work - to do work that “speaks for itself”. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite - **for knowledge work, the performance of the work is the work.**_

    > _1\. Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, then network drives success_
    > 
    > _2\. Team success requires diversity and balance, however a single individual will receive credit for the groups achievement_
    > 
    > _3\. With persistence, success can come at any time_

In short, maintain your (diverse) network, persevere, take chances and make sure to take credit.
