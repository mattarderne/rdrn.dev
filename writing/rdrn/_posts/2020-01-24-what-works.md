### **World**

[China and AI](http://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxNUctu6yAQ_Rqzs8XDDumCRW5uI3XRzdXdWxgmNooBC4ZW-ftit4tKaB5HzMw5M0YjzDE91RYzkpIhjc4qLuUgJSdWUcmNnIjL4z0BeO1WRbYyrc5odDHsn5nkvSCLepl6Aaxn9_tZstNJi8kKczbnwXDa2zMn-4hRF-sgGFDwAekZA5BVLYhbIy4Nv9VnUowPsOj8BKmLaa4Yp-ylOsb2eKgmA7gwt6t7QKvbuwsOoc1YxbRem8UF2JuJW0E_Gu037ebQiL_vGrHhA5d5t_T_Esu84HfyFg73B_AToManvdaDdcXXykP6D5hjSQYq-A8-ChxVAT7zCoiQiFOcckoZ42zoB0o71l0uA7tSemXXE7u93kTTUz-zLpepUjaPzkRPkvKdThZSpd7TeR934HXZY_W-VInPEYKeVrAKUwGC30c71orPDdQvFge4X5JzwSmpo2ysPYNKNoUv6Amlww) - The best bear case for China I’ve yet to come across:

> In short, there is a very plausible set of mechanisms under which machine learning and related techniques may turn out to be a disaster for authoritarianism, reinforcing its weaknesses rather than its strengths, by increasing its tendency to bad decision making, and reducing further the possibility of negative feedback that could help correct against errors

### **Existential**

The dual threat this week of [climate-change](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/01/grim-new-definition-generation-x) and a [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_outbreak_of_novel_coronavirus_(2019-nCoV)) from China sharpens the mind, especially with attention snatchers like the following, which I suppose may be true of any time in history.

> People born in the 1960s may be the last human beings who will get to live out their full actuarial life expectancies

### **Work**

Two ways to make sure you get the most out of your career.

1.  How to be [effective](http://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJwlUEGOgzAMfE1zWxQbsoFDDqhqv4FC4m2jhQQlZit-v6GVLI81tmY0dpbpkfJhtlRY7IXyFLxBrZXWKLyRGp2eRSjTTyZabViM2PZ5Cc5ySPE8Bo1dK55m8B0Ovu-dU3oeekCrFTmlQLfWDroXp8Vkdx8oOjL0R_lIkcRinsxbubTjBe-1OK0uB3bPJb0al9ZKoYShAsDZ-toOKl82-jqJYFCilAAIqlNSNtCMo4KrlFe4fsP9dm8vnVwf0JR9Lmzd7ykqslkbmz3lSHX9OJO9-RpuqrjuMfAxUbTzQt5w3knw50nvGHxsZCK9ykLMlD_k-TnEFqWoVj5VzWiyz_Ef1Y10wA) in the theatre of work:

    > _The office is a theatre, and work is an unfolding narrative on the stage._
    > 
    > _Many people aspire to “silent success” at work - to do work that “speaks for itself”. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite - **for knowledge work, the performance of the work is the work.**_

    > _1\. Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, then network drives success_
    > 
    > _2\. Team success requires diversity and balance, however a single individual will receive credit for the groups achievement_
    > 
    > _3\. With persistence, success can come at any time_

In short, maintain your (diverse) network, persevere, take chances and make sure to take credit.
