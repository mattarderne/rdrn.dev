<p><em>Enterprise data systems can often be quite distinct from their smaller startup cousins. This post takes a look at how our conversations around data systems and techniques need to be more sensitive to context, specifically when conversationalists have varying backgrounds.</em></p><p><em>A puddle-deep dive into the world of enterprises and how they compare to startups.</em></p><h1>Does it generalise?</h1><p>A key thing I come back to with working it data, writing about it and especially reading about it, is the following: does this generalise?

I briefly worked as a solutions engineer for a company that nearly exclusively sold products to big enterprise companies, multinationals, banks.</p><p>This experience was <em>not agreeable</em> and shocked me in a few ways. Primarily, how incredibly complicated the enterprise customer operations can be, and how dysfunctionally the enterprise customers ran their technology projects.</p><p>Complicated is fine, <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/cynefin-framework.htm">complicated is not inherently complex</a>, and just requires careful consideration, rather than rocket science, to figure out what to do. But in these older businesses, what to do is staggeringly complicated.</p><p>And so if you have worked in a startup, you may experience enterprise as static, as if nothing happens.</p><p>Well, things happen, just nothing changes,</p><p>At least not satisfyingly so, and certainly not quick enough for any feedback loops to develop, and absolutely not long enough for anyone to be around for long enough to be held accountable for their actions.</p><p>What ends up happening is pretty organic, often incredibly misguided, and very likely even counterproductive without realising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics#cite_note-%5BPink2011%5D-4">it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Not only do systems expand well beyond their original goals, but as they evolve they tend to oppose even their own original goals. … For example, incentive reward systems set up in business can have the effect of institutionalizing mediocrity. This leads to the following principle. <em><strong>Systems tend to oppose their own proper function.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Working in a company selling software was great, but selling to such established mega-corps was not my style of toasted cheese sandwich. </p><p>This blog has simmered as a comparison between Startup-land and "your typical lower tier enterprise". <strong>The result is a massive generalisation</strong>, highlighting the best of startups and comparing them to the worst of enterprise. I have a minor sliver of context, and I'm adding it to the mix. I'm not an enterprise/startup expert, but I do have experience, which means I have some context to share.</p><p>Many people in this space go their whole lives not looking under the hood of an enterprise, or startup, and this is for them.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png" width="1456" height="710" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:710,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5283102,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255bcb25-cf47-45d7-bed6-6e604e99de9a_1989x970.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">LinkedIn or Twitter - <a href="https://www.artmajeur.com/en/magazine/29-pop-culture/octavio-ocampo-s-metamorphic-paintings/331291">source</a></figcaption></figure></div><h1>So what about startups</h1><p>Anyone reading this probably has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)">idea</a> of startup land.</p><p>Startups have the benefit of a mostly clean slate, minimal baggage and an attitude of <strong>must take the time to get the tech systems right.</strong> Data is very often part of the strategic differentiation (guided or <a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning">misguided</a> as it may be).</p><p>Single data system, single tech, migrate quickly, do it now, cutting edge, <em>sorry cancel the contract we turned that off</em>.</p><p>Often wrong but always correcting, both the data stack and the company. Startups pivot on a cent(dime/penny), making extremely confident moves, with everyone in the team ready to have their role/responsibility severely disrupted, and be thrilled about it (unless you get fired).</p><p>Some great points I seem to have copied from <a href="https://locallyoptimistic.slack.com/archives/CHF1E9NUS/p1641404224097000">a slack</a> about what to expect at a startup if you’ve only worked in an enterprise:</p><blockquote><p>You will ALWAYS be building the plane as you fly it. Take time to step back and really think about your foundation and the scale it needs to operate at.<br><br>My advice would be to try to be as ‘T’ shaped as possible. Don’t worry about being amazing at lots of things - just be <em>good enough</em> at lots of things and <em>best-in-team</em> at one thing in particular.</p><p>Just do things, permission is unaffordable overhead.</p><p>Prioritize aggressively because if you do the wrong things the company dies.</p></blockquote><p>Hot on the trail of customer needs and wants, iterating through the early stages of getting product market fit, and then once the <em>scaleup stage</em> is reached, all hands to the optimisation engine.</p><p>Startups are relatively simple - everyone is aligned. If not then it is probably just a small enterprise.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li><p>Uncompromised, as everything matters, and the business will probably fail</p></li><li><p>Any single failure could be fatal, but only can be minimally mitigated</p></li><li><p>Aligned incentives</p></li><li><p>Fragile, like a newly lit fire with massive potential 🧨</p></li></ul><h3>Scale-ups?</h3><p>Scale-ups are what happens when a startup does exceedingly well (product market fit or excessive funding) and transitions from chaos into chaos on a mad hiring spree. The metamorphosis is described <a href="https://compilerqueen.substack.com/p/when-growth_stage-pupa">here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The growth of a company from startup to enterprise has a lot in common with the growth of a caterpillar into a butterfly. And those parallels are especially meaningful when you’re in the goopy, amorphous pupa phase.</p><p>It can be disorienting to go from a stage where the emphasis is on quick execution for immediate results to a stage where ideas take longer to incubate and impact is measured in years, not days.</p></blockquote><p>Often enough a chaotic nightmare where no one knows what truly matters. The inherent value of this stage is being tested by the current lack of growth VC funding. </p><p>Pouring fuel on the fire now that you won’t smother it 🔥</p><h1>So then what about enterprise</h1><p>Enterprise is entirely different. With endless silos, centralising and decentralising efforts, complicated by mergers, locations, borders, timezones and subdivisions. The focus of data is on basic coherence, control, and standardisation.</p><p>I'm not talking about Apple here. <a href="twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1574729116850561024">FAANG</a> doesn't have this issue, they just build solutions. CV buffering for engineers, they have other issues. They have issues relating to hiring people they don't need to prevent other FAANGs from having access to them, and other rumours about <a href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1412322657907793925">deliberately depressing profits</a>.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></p><p>I am talking about your mid-tier banks, in forgotten regions. Companies that need technology to survive, but have a complicated relationship with it. Think COBOL stories. Think of General Electric post-merger with one of the 100's of companies in one of the very many sectors. Declining profits, fired CEOs, disillusioned staff. Failed <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/human-capital/01_ERP_Top10_Challenges.pdf">ERP</a> implementations. The long tail of companies that just exist on momentum and middle management careering.</p><p>At a true enterprise, one can expect many legacy tech stacks, each with a plan and migration timeline. Keep it reliable, supported, staffed and contracted, ideally a single vendor.</p><p>What this leads to is <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/bullshit-software-projects/#:~:text=the%20Zombie%20Projects.-,Zombie%20Projects,was%20the%20case%20at%20the%20networking%20start%2Dup%20he%20worked%20at%3A,-We%20had%20no">Zombie Projects</a>, with incredibly disillusioned teams running them:</p><blockquote><p>when a project has failed or has ballooned in size to the extent that it will never be completed, and everyone knows it.

Digitisation? Yes if you must, no one wants to call for a delivery update. Cloud? Probably.</p><p>So Modern Data Stack then? Well, it comes with a way of working, an ethos around software best practices, some thoughts around who is responsible for what, and how to engage as an impactful product minded team.</p><p>Therein lies hope. Where Hadoop was a big data solution, Modern analytics is possibly a <a href="https://twitter.com/bennstancil/status/1605969780636205057">process</a> improvement. Doing things a bit more coherently. A slightly easier way to do the same old.</p><p>But I worry that it is probably not enough, or not even the case.</p><p>The ease with which enterprise data modelling experts have co-opted the data modelling conversation on LinkedIn tells me that the more likely post-fact analysis is going to lead to something along the lines of:</p><div class="preformatted-block"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false"></label><pre class="text">MDS brought Enterprise capabilities to Startups, <strong>and not the other way around.</strong></pre></div><p>That is a shuddering thought if there ever was one?</p><p>As mentioned, and regardless, Modern Data Stack has started simmering in the Enterprise, and is now well on its way.

But now business is just as technical as IT. So their roles are shifting and you get a much more balanced environment between what the business makes decisions on and what IT is really in charge of, because IT doesn't really know how to apply technology to the business, but the business does. We see that balance changing.</p><p>And I have that conversation often, by the way, with CIOs who are your typical infrastructure guys, they manage for cost and risk and these kinds of things. But they're infrastructure people, they really are enablers, but they don't really know how technology impacts the business.
