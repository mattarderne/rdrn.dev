<p><em>The beauty of ideas is that they cannot die. That said, many consider the Modern Data Stack <a href="https://twitter.com/matsonj/status/1691245983911567360">to have developed a bit of a rot</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> I thought to pull out the eulogy I've had in the back of my mind for a while.

These don’t map perfectly, and number three doesn’t fit the enterprise context. The idea: Something new catches on, it grows big, it loses its way, there is a fight / collapse / phase-change and then it stabilises.

Redshift precipitated a change and Snowflake accelerated it. Pay-per-query.</p><p>Redshift and Snowflake laid the soil that led to the Modern Data Stack. They created the easiest to buy large scale data storage that anyone had ever seen. The problem now became keeping track of the transformations necessary to deal with the <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/mattarderne/status/1684462316278910976">vast data recycling centres</a></strong> that were suddenly viable to be created by smaller and smaller teams.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/tree/549282110f393a22c6331ba828a4895bdee9c26e">dbt</a>, a relatively generic idea (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12862474">SQL templating</a> in python) became the foundation for a new movement to deal with the issue, <a href="https://medium.com/fishtown-analytics/the-missing-layers-of-the-analytics-stack-af420e6214bd">right place, people, audience, right time</a>. </p><p>I was instantly hooked. dbt took the lead among <a href="https://medium.com/@jthandy/the-modern-data-platform-is-too-big-to-fit-on-one-slide-377b9d28d01e">an array of relatively fragmented solutions</a> all jockeying around the task at hand.</p><h4>MDS NAME COINED / FIRST BLOGS</h4><p>A brief google and it seems like dbt first used the term "Modern Data Stack” on <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/blog/how-do-you-decide-what-to-model-in-dbt-vs-lookml/#:~:text=The%20modern%20data%20stack%20is%20modular">January 29, 2018</a>, (I couldn’t be bothered to dig any deeper, history in the form of a sea-shanty with a broken banjo).</p><p>The concept caught on. I was working as a Data Engineer doing Redshift transformations, dbt achieved this in a far better way. Before that, doing this stuff was super expensive, testing and version control was tricky, everything was slow.</p><p>Blogs came out describing the way. Here I generously <a href="https://groupby1.substack.com/p/dataform-and-dbt#:~:text=They%20generously%20shared,startup%20data%20analytics">quote myself</a> describing the series of blog posts that introduced the new way</p><blockquote><p>We, the desperate, listened closely. The message I heard: <em>bring the best of software development to startup data analytics</em></p></blockquote><p>I was likely referring to this <a href="https://medium.com/fishtown-analytics/the-missing-layers-of-the-analytics-stack-af420e6214bd">blog post</a>. It all sounds rather exciting in retrospect, and it was!</p><h4>MDS MINDSET / MANIFESTO / PRINCIPLES / EVANGELISTS</h4><p>The whole thing coalesced (yup) around the <strong>Community</strong>. dbt slack and Locally Optimistic slack were the <a href="https://perell.com/fellowship/conjuring-scenius/#:~:text=When%20those%20inside%20the%20cutting%2Dedge%20scenes%20band%20together%20to%20support%2C%20teach%2C%20and%20create%20with%20each%20other%2C%20their%20niche%20and%20experimental%20projects%20can%20become%20the%20new%20normal%20on%20top%20of%20which%20the%20next%20generation%20builds">absolute centre</a>(s) of the data world for a fair amount of time.</p><blockquote><p>When those inside the cutting-edge scenes band together to support, teach, and create with each other, their niche and experimental projects can become the new normal on top of which the next generation builds.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/community-rules-of-the-road">vendor guidelines</a> kept things civil in the dbt chat, and Locally Optimistic was generally smaller and less frantic. Dbt was often the target of staffing firms who would point their junior devs at the dbt slack and say <em>“here is your technical support”</em> and they would paste 200 line error logs into the main chat and say <strong>“what do??” </strong>and then disappear. </p><p>I think a real kicker was the <strong>Open Source</strong> hook. Everyone wants to work with open source software. Now <a href="https://medium.com/fishtown-analytics/its-time-for-open-source-analytics-194902ae5c5">data people could do that</a>!  </p><p>There were reams of <strong>Guides</strong>, <a href="https://groupby1.substack.com/p/data-as-a-utility-tool">here is mine</a>. (filler content for <a href="https://dataform.co/blog/data-tools">Dataform</a>, now acquired by Google). The writing wasn’t very good in hindsight, but I stand by my suggestions, <em>move fast with</em> <em>simple tools</em>. Here is another <a href="https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/one-size-fits-none/">good guide</a>. These ideas were evaluated on some or other believability and the good ideas were amplified.</p><p>Alongside this, <strong>Validation</strong> that the <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/blog/analytics-is-a-trade/">data trade was noble</a> fanned the flames.</p><p>dbt ran their <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/blog/coalesce-2020/">first conference in 2020</a>. <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce-2021/keynote-how-big-is-this-wave/">2021 they ran their second</a>, this time it got big.</p><h1>Phase 2: Growth</h1><div class="pullquote"><p>Because it’s so new, there is a vast frontier, waiting to be explored. Anyone willing to work hard can go to some virgin tract of ideaspace and start mining it for status. <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-cyclic-theory-of-subcultures">The returns on talent are high.</a></p></div><h4>MDS BIG WINS</h4><p>Snowflake IPO <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/16/investing/snowflake-ipo/index.html">late 2020</a> set things in motion, the biggest software IPO ever was just the beginning of the end for MDS. dbt raised a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dbt-labs/company_financials">ton of money</a>, so did Fivetran and most of the others.</p><h4>EXPLOSION OF MDS PATTERNS / BEST PRACTICES</h4><p><a href="https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/category/tools/">Locally Optimistic</a> was always and remains an ardent supporter of delivering relatively hype-free and insightful best practices. Their community remains well moderated and insightful, with very friendly and well moderated non-vendor participants. Remains a top place to visit. </p><p><a href="https://clrcrl.com/2021/03/03/how-to-build-a-community-why">Community best practices</a> and advice about <a href="https://clrcrl.com/2022/05/06/mds-company-slack">starting a company community slack</a> started to pop up. If you were VC backed, you need 1000+ people in your slack otherwise how would you get any product feedback. This worked well in my opinion, despite the snark. If I am legitimately interested in your product I’d love to speak to the engineer building it. Companies started adding the slack activity into their go-to-market strategy, ELT’ing my activity into their CDP for better PLG or whatever. </p><h4>SMALL MDS CONSULTANCIES</h4><p>An acquaintance (or quite a few actually) went full throttle on consulting and quickly employed 100s of people and made a ton of revenue with massive companies.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>dbt has a huge <a href="https://partners.getdbt.com/english/directory/search?f0=Partner+Type&amp;f0v0=Consulting+Partner&amp;f1=Partner+Tier&amp;f1v0=Premier+Partner">list of vendors</a>. This was the most reliable way to make good money in the Modern Data Stack ecosystem, but the allure of building products pulled lots of people into building data tools instead.</p><h4>YOU ARE NOT DOING MDS / CERTIFICATIONS TITLES</h4><p>The need to teach analysts how to be <em><strong>Analytics Engineers </strong></em>was pretty clear, they needed git, python, jinja, Data models, star schemas, denormalization, Kimball.</p><p>A few courses came out doing this stuff, first was the <a href="https://analyticsengineers.club/course-overview/">Analytics Engineers Club</a>. I think the <strong>data modelling skills </strong>described are super useful, and generally fell into something that Data Engineers didn’t do and Analysts didn’t do, and so they were just ignored. </p><p>This wasn’t explicitly gatekeeping, more just demand being met by an increase in supply. I was firmly of the opinion that hiring ops people was beneficial in this space as they could easily grasp the tech and generally had a better sense for the problems that were worth addressing. </p><h4>MDS VENDORS FUND CONFERENCES</h4><p>There were a few <a href="https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/summit">smaller conferences</a> other than Coalesce (the conference), and Snowflake summits, <a href="https://www.datacouncil.ai/">Data Council</a> seemed to be the most consistently worthwhile.</p><p>In 2021 the dbt <a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/delirium#:~:text=This%20cultural%20energy%20reaches%20its%20crescendo%20during%20Coalesce%2C%20dbt%20Labs%E2%80%99%20annual%20conference">Coalesce conference</a> peaked:</p><blockquote><p>This cultural energy reaches its crescendo during <a href="https://coalesce.getdbt.com/">Coalesce</a>, dbt Labs’ annual conference. The conference ostensibly takes place over a number of live-streamed talks, but its beating heart is on Slack. Every talk inspires a tidal wave of excitement, encouragement, and general good cheer. Every channel is the parents’ section at track meet: Ready to erupt when their kid crosses the finish line, and equally ready to hop the fence and pick them up if they fall.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h4>MDS ECOSYSTEM INFOGRAPHICS</h4><p>The vast ecosystem now needed a map, <a href="https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/community">ModernDataStack.XYZ</a> maps out the components, and I think does an adequate job of categorising them.</p><p>Here is <a href="https://www.indicative.com/resource/modern-data-infrastructure/">another map</a>, with their criteria giving you an idea of the qualifying criteria. <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><h4>MDS VENDOR COMPETITION HEATS UP!</h4><p>Once the ball started rolling, there was a lot of money being poured into the space. New BI tools, new ELT, data quality, data reliability, observability, metrics, semantics, all started being picked over.  </p><p>I wrote a blog comparing dbt and Dataform. Dataform was acquired as mentioned, and dbt took centre stage, centre diagram. </p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;1742052e-9a70-40e9-b8ed-49cd9c32e113&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Welcome to my third post, one I have wanted to write from the beginning.

The awkwardly named <a href="https://coalesce.io/">Coalesce</a> was the first early dbt alternative since Dataform (Coalesce is also the name of dbt’s conference). I don’t know much about it.</p><h4>MDS GARTNER MAGIC QUADRANT</h4><p>There isn’t a fully fledged Gartner Quadrant. The whole point of MDS was all the unbundled solutions. There was a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/peer-community/poll/modern-data-stack-component-looking">post on their forum</a>. I predict we will see a “new wave” once all the tools are more consolidated and Gartner figures out how to position all of this. </p><p>I guess there are likely enterprise equivalently branded MDS style solutions that have happened. The only funny one I could find within 5 seconds of Googling was <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/z-and-cloud-modernization-stack">IBM Gen z/X</a>.   </p><h4>OFFERINGS TO SOLVE MDS PROBLEMS</h4><p>I <strong>almost</strong> wrote a blog decrying the state of things when I was spammed by an ex digitisation evangelist crypto expert, now selling <em><strong>data-something-dot-AI</strong></em>. Selling magic and then supplying junior analysts with git and SQL just stank of an enterprise sales cycle. This was indicative of the beginning of the end.</p><h4>DON'T DO MDS / ENTERPRISE MDS</h4><p><strong>Data mesh</strong> was the funniest part of the entire data hype cycle. Effectively a fully fledged framework to decentralise data ownership, it read like a<strong> Business School Blockchain Certification</strong> (apparently, I didn’t read it). The response from the MDS pure snark. <a href="https://databased.pedramnavid.com/p/the-last-thing-ill-ever-say-about">Pedram had the last word here</a>. I guess maybe you had to be there.</p><p>There was heated posturing on Linkedin about the failure of MDS to properly address the <strong>problem of data modelling</strong>. Data Vault, Anchor modelling.

And it is, <strong>arguably, elitist</strong> (as those are the most bleeding-edge, best-in-breed tools, serving the needs of the more sophisticated users with the more advanced use cases).</p></blockquote><p>Overfunded startups, overcrowded teams, too many compute credits, too much badly structured SQL and lots of criticism. </p><p>The substance boiled down: </p><p><strong>MDS was a series of relatively experimental tools strung together to demonstrate varyingly good levels of Product Market Fit, but not quite demonstrating an ideal operating model . </strong></p><p><strong>The result is a great target for more refined, more niche, bundled equivalents. </strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png" width="727.9948120117188" height="479.3870598825468" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:484,&quot;width&quot;:735,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:727.9948120117188,&quot;bytes&quot;:452539,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5a1c705-cf73-4e24-a26d-11b3f16182f7_735x484.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">“Mrs Armitage full-send on her MDS”  - The analogy here is that the bike demonstrates the makings of a motorcar. <a href="https://www.quentinblake.com/gallery/mrs-armitage-under-full-sail">I’d love a copy of this poster. - rights reserved Quentin Blake </a></figcaption></figure></div><h1>Phase 4: Postcycle</h1><div class="pullquote"><p>At some point, everyone realizes you can’t get easy status from the subculture anymore. <br><strong><a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-cyclic-theory-of-subcultures">The people who want easy status stop joining</a></strong><a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-cyclic-theory-of-subcultures">, </a><br>and the movement stabilizes in a low-growth state.</p></div><h4>END OF MDS STATUS GAMES</h4><p>There is less attention and so less opportunity for status games.

The same applies to operations. </p><h4>MDS CONSOLIDATES WITH FOCUS</h4><p>The <strong>data systems are largely </strong><em><strong>good enough</strong></em> and so the bottleneck becomes what to do with the data. Data engineering <em><strong>was</strong></em> the bottleneck. In January 2022 I gave the opinion that Data Engineering was <a href="https://groupby1.substack.com/p/data-engineering">no longer the primary bottleneck</a> to delivering insights/value/whatever.</p><p>Now in August 2023, I will now say that <strong>the Data Function is no longer the primary bottleneck</strong> in delivering insights/value<strong>. </strong>A good data team can ingest, model, analyse and distribute insights pretty easily.
