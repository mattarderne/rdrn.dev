When you learn to navigate a modern sailboat, you are instructed to determine your location by taking 3 compass readings, resulting in a triangle, resolving to a fair chance that you are <strong>or at least were </strong>in that triangle.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg" width="620" height="412" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:412,&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.paddlinglight.com/pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fix-example.jpg?fit=620%2C412&amp;ssl=1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="https://i1.wp.com/www.paddlinglight.com/pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fix-example.jpg?fit=620%2C412&amp;ssl=1" title="https://i1.wp.com/www.paddlinglight.com/pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fix-example.jpg?fit=620%2C412&amp;ssl=1" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6cee5b7-07f7-4672-a557-5c2cab02fc75_620x412.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">3 lines are better than 2.

He needed to stop halfway across to refuel, and the tolerance for missing the refuelling stop at Lord Howe Island was near zero. If he wasn’t able to land there, <strong>he’d certainly be beyond rescue or recovery.</strong></p><p>He was suddenly outrunning the metrics layer of a previous generation (neat), so he needed to <a href="https://www.a-e-g.org.uk/sir-francis-chichester.html">develop his own</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The challenge of the Tasman remained and Chichester realised that he could reach Australia if he fitted [the plane] with floats to alight on the sea and refuel at Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island.</p><p>The real problem now was to find these tiny spots in the sea. The only method of position-fixing available was to take sunshots with a sextant - not easy when you’re alone in the cramped vibrating cockpit - then laboriously work out the fix with pencil and paper.</p><p>He decided to use the principle of ‘off-course navigation’ i.e. deliberately aiming for a point to one side of the island. When this point was reached there would be no doubt which way to make a 90º turn for the final leg to the island. To reduce potential errors in calculation, Chichester worked out a series of examples based on his estimate of the sun’s position at the time of his expected arrival at critical points on his course.</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png" width="700" height="367" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:367,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:298199,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0558efd2-2ff4-40a6-96b5-f90adb84168b_700x367.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Notice the dog-leg about 1 3rd of the way across (East to West) — <a href="https://www.a-e-g.org.uk/sir-francis-chichester.html">More pics</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The primary issue was around the speed at which he moved, but through a clever application of logic and tolerance for approximations, he managed (quite literally barely based on the reading of his book) to make it across.</p><p>He then went on to become the Chief Data Officer for the Royal Airforce flying school (training WW2 pilots), a prolific seller of maps, as well as a solo sailor (which is where he became famous).</p><p>The point here is that he was moving too fast for existing methods. The dynamic was changing too quickly for existing technologies. SQL Server SSIS was no longer sufficient. It may have been sufficient if you were doing milk runs in a steamship from Bristol to Londonderry (or a mid-tier bank with a CIO intent on minimal risk), but certainly not if you were trying to set a navigation record across the Tasman sea.</p><h1><strong>The Data Navigator</strong></h1><p>This is the link: Data + Navigation</p><p>Today, the problem of longitude has been solved to centimetre accuracy through satellite navigation<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a>. However, the reason for the strong nautical-themed trivia, is that they demonstrate an excellent ability to manage and thrive with uncertainty.</p><p>Both Chichester and Cook knew the limitations of the BI tools of their time. They supplemented these with experience and intelligence to surmount what were pretty tough odds, to get to wherever they felt needed arriving.</p><p>For clarity, most navigators are indeed supporting roles to the Captain. The Navigator would use their combined technical skills, intuition and experience (collectively, wisdom) to give the Captain guidance on where and when. The Captain would then integrate all insights into their resource planning (a startup on the sea).</p><p>What is clear is that the Navigator didn’t rely on navigation aids as a crutch, but rather as means to better outcomes through a clear understanding of the weaknesses and an attempt at improving them.</p><p>So what is all of this leading to?</p><p><strong>First,</strong> the Data Navigator is a useful analogy for startups and their data abuse. </p><p>When exploring, there is a benefit to be had from pushing into the unknown, and new methods are often required.</p><p><strong>Second,</strong> bad data causes problems. Often it’s not the data, but rather the navigator.</p><p><strong>Third,</strong> the navigator provides context which can be used as part of a higher purpose: alignment, motivation and maybe even consensus.</p><p>Three thoughts, three sections. Back to the sea, from whence we came.</p><h1><strong>1 - Exploration as a startup analogy</strong></h1><p>Navigation is well applied to the data team when the team is supporting the exploration of new worlds.</p><p>What the navigator does is supplement and confirm a mental model that someone has built about how the world works.</p><h3><strong>The map is not the territory</strong></h3><p>The idea maze maps nicely from historical exploration to startups - barely anything is known and there is a commercial framework based on discovery leading to reward. A startup is entirely lost, by definition, in the <a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/startup/lecture_slides/lecture5-market-wireframing-design.pdf">idea maze</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A good founder is capable of anticipating which turns lead to treasure and which lead to certain death. A bad founder is just running to the entrance of (say) the “movies/music/filesharing/P2P” maze …&nbsp; without any sense for the history of the industry, the players in the maze, the casualties of the past, and the technologies that are likely to move walls and change assumptions.</p></blockquote><p>The navigator has a theory about where they are and are going. This information complements the plan.</p><p>The startup has a plan of action and looks for confirmation or invalidation.</p><p>A navigator needs to understand their science in addition to the history and futures of their space. This becomes acutely more important when there is some form of race, as was typically the case with all historic navigation.</p><h3><strong>Innovation mixed in with luck and intuition</strong></h3><p>A great supplement to this is that the navigator doesn’t rely entirely on data. They use it to complement their intuition.</p><p>In a rapidly developing environment, the intuition delivered by a navigator gives an indication of which inputs can be trusted over others, what to prioritise and how to simplify the decision space.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></p><p>I think the Data Navigator concept echoes the purpose of data within a risky environment, where there is upside to getting <em>it</em> right.</p><h1><strong>2 - When it goes wrong</strong></h1><p>There are many documented situations where among other failings, huge ships just run aground.</p><blockquote><p>He left her on autopilot, but strong currents overnight pushed the ship to the north and east and the chief officer altered her course towards the north.

Being sure of what they know, and balancing this with what they don’t.</p><p>Navigators provide the best supplement to decision making, trading off speed against accuracy, and relying on intuition, and overcoming ingrained preconceptions and bias.</p><h3><strong>Speed not haste</strong></h3><p>Accuracy trades off against speed almost directly.</p><p>Crucially, this needs to be seen in the appropriate context. Some data teams function to ensure accuracy. In that context, the Navigator mindset is likely misapplied, and it’s probably better to rely on an auditor/historian mindset<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a>.</p><p>Startups require speed, due to competition. Accounting requires accuracy, due to compliance.</p><p>Speed and hurry should not be seen as excuses for bad data. As with navigation, so with data, there are pretty firm fundamentals that are easy to achieve, can be effectively relied upon and supplement measurement and improvement of the basics.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></p><blockquote><p>"To err is human, but to persist [in error] is diabolical." </p><p>— <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/errare_humanum_esthttps://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/errare_humanum_est">Latinum Sayinum</a></p></blockquote><p>As a navigation route starts to mature and grow in traffic, then the balance favours accuracy, to drive efficiency. Similar dynamic when a startup becomes an established scale-up.</p><h3><strong>Hierarchy</strong></h3><p>It should be noted that the Nautical Navigator operates in a strictly hierarchical environment. There are no committees at sea, the Captain has the final word, typically for good reason, though the shipping disaster earlier indicates how this becomes an issue, as described in <a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/black-box-thinking/">Black Box Thinking</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When we are confronted with evidence that challenges our deeply held beliefs we are more likely to reframe the evidence than we are to alter our beliefs. We simply invent new reasons, new justifications, new explanations. Sometimes we ignore the evidence altogether.</p></blockquote><p>Many maritime disasters, when deconstructed, relate to power dynamic issues, indicating mental inflexibility around what was true. Running your ship into a reef or ignoring a warning about a storm are great examples of ignoring the data.</p><p>This is because new insights are disruptive and hard to integrate. People are happier with consensus than they are with uncertainty, even when the uncertainty might save them.</p><blockquote><p>Organisations think they want more insights and innovation.</p><p>They are deluding themselves.</p><p>Organisations suppress insights for reasons that are locked inside their corporate DNA: <strong>organisations prize predictability and they recoil from errors</strong>. </p><p>— <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/gary-klein">Gary Klein</a></p></blockquote><p>Granted that the above line was in the context of innovation, not avoiding disaster, but the same “don’t rock the boat” mentality underlies both aversions to innovation and failing to avert course.</p><p>My anecdote - If you are on a UK train and someone is in your seat, and has the same seat booked, <strong>then</strong> <strong>at least</strong> <strong>one of you is on the wrong train</strong> - an uncomfortable insight.</p><p>The hardest thing for the navigator to overcome is an unwanted insight.</p><h1><strong>3 - Purpose</strong></h1><p>To bring things closer to the point then. A data team ultimately brings a shared context to an organisation. <strong>We are here, and aiming there.</strong></p><p>As we know, the shared context is abstract, flexible, and transient. All the data does is add a foundation to the abstraction of reality we use to support and enhance our shared context. The data tends to be the one part that is consistent, reliable and infallible.</p><p>This has an underlying seemingly heretical belief: <strong>a single source of truth is an abstraction</strong>.</p><p>Single source of truth is a fairytale, data teams help reconcile this untruth.</p><p>What it looks like is shared context, with firmly drawn lines, in pen, on paper, that indicate that the boundary of the territory is exactly HERE.</p><h3>Trails </h3><p>And so what the data team does is simplify, create some abstractions, and identify options, and trails:</p><blockquote><p>Complete freedom is not what a trail offers. Quite the opposite; a trail is a tactful reduction of options.</p><p>― Robert Moor, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/47328278">On Trails: An Exploration</a></p></blockquote><p>This is to simplify and create shorthands, narratives, and reasonable decisions.</p><p>However, the Data Navigator needs to keep this simplification in mind, always apply their experience and skill to avoid disaster, and ensure the drift from reality to map isn’t too severe:</p><p>The map maker, the surveyor, the compass reader, the ships crew, and everyone that had some part in the determination of the final pen to paper knows that there are many sources of uncertainty, each possibly extending the truth in their own limited capacity that may indeed lead to the pen on paper determination being slightly but disastrously off.</p><blockquote><p>We had 424,000 daily active users yesterday.” The pessimetricist thinks — hopefully, he does not say this — “Actually, you had in excess of 424,000 HTTP requests from devices associated at least temporarily with unique user accounts registered in your internal systems over a 24-hour time period that survived a number of arbitrary assumptions in your data processing systems that passed muster six months ago but which haven’t been re-evaluated meaningfully since. </p><p>— <a href="https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/beyond-one-and-zerohttps://stkbailey.substack.com/p/beyond-one-and-zero">Stephen Bailey</a></p></blockquote><p>But pen to paper it is, and from that moment onwards, and until a better map is created, that is the single source of truth, the true story.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></p><div
