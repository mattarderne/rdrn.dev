I work with data teams to improve the their data systems and processes, using modern cloud data technology. 

Analytics Engineering is the closest approximation. 

Get in touch if you’d like to discuss analytics technology. I work as both an advisor and engineer with teams in the UK, US and Africa.

## Experience 
I have experience in early and scale stage tech businesses - having worked and advised to successful companies on their data, product, engineering, hiring, outsourcing, tech, strategy, growth. I've advised to VC funded growth businesses, bootstrapped startups, consulting firms and stable enterprise clients. I'm comfortable talking to the CEO and the back-end developer, and I'm willing to get my hands dirty to get the job done.

## Offering

I prefer working with businesses who's product, mission and direction I understand and agree with, and would want to establish an ongoing relationship with the leadership and team.

I like to take an open minded approach to each new conversation, and strive to bring value and clarity to each opportunity.
