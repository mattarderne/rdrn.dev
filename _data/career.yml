chapters:
  - id: "origin"
    period: "Early Years"
    title: "Industrial Engineering"
    location: "South Africa"
    headline: "Learning to make decisions with data"

    what_i_did:
      - "Studied Industrial Engineering - the discipline of optimizing complex systems"
      - "Developed analytical thinking and decision-making frameworks"
      - "Combined technical skills with business understanding"

    why_i_chose_this: |
      Industrial Engineering is all about making decisions - understanding systems,
      identifying bottlenecks, and finding the optimal path forward. I was drawn to
      the intersection of technical problem-solving and real-world business impact.

    what_i_was_thinking: |
      I wanted a foundation that would let me work on meaningful problems, not just
      technical puzzles. IE gave me the tools to think about systems holistically.

    what_i_learned:
      - "Systems thinking - everything is connected"
      - "Data-driven decision making is a superpower"
      - "The best solutions consider human factors, not just technical optimums"

    pivot_moment: |
      Realized that data was becoming the new oil, and the skills to extract
      value from it were in short supply. Decided to double down on data.

  - id: "focal"
    period: "Consulting"
    title: "Focal - Fintech Analytics"
    location: "London"
    headline: "Consulting in fintech analytics space"
    link: "https://hellofocal.com"

    what_i_did:
      - "Built analytics solutions for fintech companies"
      - "Helped businesses understand their data and make better decisions"
      - "Developed expertise in financial data systems"

    why_i_chose_this: |
      Fintech was reshaping how money moves. I wanted to be at that intersection
      of finance and technology, helping companies leverage data to compete.

    what_i_was_thinking: |
      Consulting would expose me to many different problems and business models.
      Each client was a new puzzle to solve.

    what_i_learned:
      - "Every company thinks their data problems are unique (they're not)"
      - "The hardest part isn't the tech - it's getting people aligned"
      - "Speed matters in fintech - iterate fast or get left behind"

    pivot_moment: |
      Saw the same data infrastructure problems repeated across clients.
      Started thinking about building solutions rather than just consulting.

  - id: "reinform"
    period: "Research"
    title: "reinform.io - Misinformation Research"
    location: "Remote"
    headline: "Applying network analytics to media"
    link: "http://reinform.io"

    what_i_did:
      - "Researched how misinformation spreads through networks"
      - "Applied network analytics techniques to media ecosystems"
      - "Built tools to track and understand information flow"

    why_i_chose_this: |
      Misinformation was (and is) one of the defining challenges of our time.
      I wanted to apply my data skills to something with societal impact.

    what_i_was_thinking: |
      If we can understand how information spreads, maybe we can build better
      systems for truth. The network effects were fascinating technically.

    what_i_learned:
      - "Information ecosystems are incredibly complex"
      - "Technical solutions alone can't solve social problems"
      - "But they can help - visibility is the first step"

    pivot_moment: |
      The research was important but I missed building products.
      Wanted to get back to creating things people use daily.

  - id: "waves"
    period: "Side Project"
    title: "Waves - Surf Forecasting"
    headline: "Neural nets meet ocean waves"
    link: "http://rdrn.com/waves"

    what_i_did:
      - "Built a surf forecasting system using neural networks"
      - "Combined passion for surfing with data science"
      - "Explored open-data approaches to surf mapping"

    why_i_chose_this: |
      Surfing is a huge part of my life. The existing forecasting tools felt
      outdated. Why not build something better?

    what_i_was_thinking: |
      If neural nets can predict weather, they can predict waves. Plus,
      working on something you're passionate about hits different.

    what_i_learned:
      - "Side projects keep you sharp"
      - "Domain expertise + technical skills = unfair advantage"
      - "Open data communities are amazing but hard to sustain"

    pivot_moment: |
      Wrapped this up when life got busy, but the idea of open-data surf
      mapping still excites me. If you want to contribute, let me know.

  - id: "sea"
    period: "Current"
    title: "sea.dev - B2B Data Infrastructure"
    location: "London"
    headline: "Building the data layer for businesses"
    link: "https://sea.dev"
    is_current: true

    what_i_did:
      - "Co-founded sea.dev to help businesses improve their data"
      - "Building B2B data infrastructure solutions"
      - "Turning years of consulting insights into products"

    why_i_chose_this: |
      After seeing hundreds of companies struggle with the same data problems,
      it was time to build something that could help at scale.

    what_i_was_thinking: |
      The best consulting engagements always ended with "why isn't this a product?"
      Now we're building those products.

    what_i_learned:
      - "Starting a company is harder and more rewarding than expected"
      - "The problems you solve matter more than the tech you use"
      - "Every day is a new lesson"

    whats_next: |
      Focused on growth and helping more businesses get their data right.
      The opportunity is massive.
