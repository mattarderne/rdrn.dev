  description: This board has been really good so far, paddles better than I expected and feels great in better waves. Doesn't hold a rail in very big waves as I discovered at Killers in December 2020.

  description: Great in _VERY_ small waves, has a massively wide tail so really struggles in anything bigger than waist high, and especially bad in hollow waves. Very fun for waves that would otherwise be great on a longboard, and paddles incredibly well for the size. Have bought quad rear fins to try out, as this doesn't feel great as a thruster

  description: This board was super fun at The Wave artificial wave. It is one of the rental boards, and thankfully available. It definitely helped to have the extra volume as the fresh water isn't very bouyant and is freezing cold, so extra neoprene means you need the volume. The 2+1 fin configuration is great for loosening the board up, as you don't need the hold in the very weak waves they hadn't enabled Advanced+ so the wave was tiny. Would really like to get one of these for weaker surf days.

  description: This board went well in medium quality Cape Town surf. Haven't really surfed it in great surf, but feels maybe too high performance for Cape Town surf (which is generally average IMO).

  description: Funky retro replica of the original Simon Anderson Thruster. Really quite hard to surf, very sensitive to back foot weighting, doesn't really generate speed and hard to turn.

  description: This was too small. Fun at huge days at Llandudno, but otherwise too little volume. Really struggled. Creased it duckdiving a monster at Llandudno

  description: Think that or maybe a Lost Scorcher 2.. Don't know Board I bought to take to Bali. Quite a lot of volume, can't quite remember that much about it, but seemed maybe not enough rocker for the waves in Bali. Quite enjoyed it, sad to leave it there.
